Optimization algorithms or strategies reduce losses and provide the most accurate results possible.
The types of optimizers used in this program are: 
Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) works with momentums of first and second order. The intuition behind the Adam is that we donâ€™t want to roll so fast just because we can jump over the minimum, we want to decrease the velocity a little bit for a careful search. 
Here, we are taking the mean of M(t) and V(t) so that E[m(t)] can be equal to E[g(t)] where, E[f(x)] is an expected value of f(x).
